Organizations face increasing regulatory requirements that require reviewing large volumes of compliance-related documents. Manual compliance analysis is time-consuming, error-prone, costly, and difficult to scale as regulations frequently change. Existing tools lack intelligent document understanding, real-time analysis, automated reporting, and proper audit traceability. Hence, there is a need for an AI-driven, scalable system that can automatically analyze regulatory documents, identify compliance risks, generate structured reports, and maintain audit trails efficiently.
